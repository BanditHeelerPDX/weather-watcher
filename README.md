# weather-watcher

## description

To create a simple go to page that pings the weather in just about any city you can input.  Locations searched are persisted at the bottom and easily clicked to recall the local weather for that location.  Also, enjoy that sweet shot of Mt. Hood, that I took myself - I love that mountain.  [The page should look like this after you have input a location and clicked the submit button:](./screenshot.png)
